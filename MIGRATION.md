# Migration scope

Reference: vim-gin `24cce091cfa32c013bc53cf4ff8f721d6690cf24`.
The haiku55 trial is not used as implementation input.

The following scope comes from the pinned plugin, autoload, ftplugin, and
Denops source trees. A checked item means implemented and tested for its stated
scope, not proof of complete upstream parity.

- [x] Pin upstream and mini.nvim; headless mini.test harness.
- [ ] Git process execution and worktree discovery (files, subdirectories, symlinks, linked worktrees).
- [ ] Gin: arbitrary commands, argument expansion, modifiers, wait, postprocessors, indicators, events.
- [ ] GinBuffer: command output buffers, URI reads, reload and command binding.
- [ ] GinStatus: status display, path selection and all status actions.
- [ ] GinBranch, GinTag: parsed views and ref actions.
- [ ] GinLog, GinReflog, GinStash: parsed views, navigation and commit/stash actions.
- [ ] GinEdit: working tree, revision and index buffers with write-back.
- [ ] GinDiff: revision selection, read and diff navigation/folding.
- [ ] GinPatch: staging/unstaging partial changes.
- [ ] GinChaperon: conflict panes and resolution.
- [ ] GinBlame: blame navigation, history and detail.
- [ ] GinBrowse: remote URL generation and opening.
- [ ] GinCd, GinLcd, GinTcd and worktree context.
- [ ] Shared actions: choice, repeat, help, range handling and Plug mappings.
- [ ] Editor/askpass proxies, commit/rebase integration.
- [ ] Branch/traffic/worktree components and component events.
- [ ] Help, syntax, highlights, options and default mappings in Lua.
- [ ] Full command/action audit against the pinned source and real Git-state integration tests.

## Validation rules

Tests use disposable repositories and check Git state as well as displayed
content. Failures, process errors and timeouts must propagate as failures.
Include subdirectory and special-path cases for read/write actions. Shared
external resources must be isolated. Reference comparison alone is insufficient
to prove an action produces the intended Git state.
